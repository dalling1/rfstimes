RFS Times
---

The current BIRS reporting system of the NSW Rural Fire Service asks for various event times.

These can be written down or requested post-incident from fire comm, but this page is an attempt to make a simple set of clocks suitable for operation in a mobile vehicle (ie. bumpy!).

Click/press on each clock to set the timestamp.  Reload to clear.

At the moment there is no way to reset a single timestamp; this could be added in the future (or a switch to lock/unlock each entry).
